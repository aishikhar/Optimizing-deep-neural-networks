Data Files:
1. 367CasesFINAL (ORIGNAL UNEDITED)
2. apnea_new.csv : After selecting the medically relevant features as per Medical expert
3. apnea_clean.csv :
	After removing missing values as follows-

			# 1. ANINDIC was removed because it was completely textual, descriptive.
			# 2. The Patient IDs were removed, but they're sequential, so if the dataset isn't radomized, the row of the given patient corressponds to their ID.
			# 3. Removed all rows with Missing values
			# 4. Summed apnea1_3 and apnea4_7 to get apnea1_7
4. apnea_all.csv (Removing apnea1_3 and apnea4_7 and encoding apnea1_7 as 0s and 1s)
	**Also removed weird mistaken outliers**
5. apnea.csv (Using Feature selection, removed columns SURFACTANT, BIRTHCRY, BRADY1_3DAYS, ALTE)

Using apnea.csv without the Sr. No. column for further work....
