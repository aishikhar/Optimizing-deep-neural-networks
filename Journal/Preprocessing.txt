The features selected by the medical expert were taken.

Some logs here:
# 1. ANINDIC was removed because it was completely textual, descriptive.
# 2. The Patient IDs were removed, but they're sequential, so if the dataset isn't radomized, the row of the given patient corressponds to their ID.
# 3. Removed all rows with Missing values
# 4. Summed apnea1_3 and apnea4_7 to get apnea1_7
